MooTools Tree Components - Copyright (c) 2009 [Christoph Pojer](http://cpojer.net/)
=====================================================================================

A set of components to sort and/or collapse/expand a Tree. The state can also be saved in a Cookie.

## Tree
The Tree class makes it possible to sort any nested unordered list and to serialize the output.
It is similar to the Sortable plugin in MooTools-More, allowing the user to interact and rearrange
nodes via Drag&Drop.

## Collapse
Allows the user to expand/collapse nodes to quickly hide and show subnodes.

## Collapse.Cookie
Works like the Collapse class but also stores the current state in a cookie so it persists on page reloads.
